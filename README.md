# Plugin README Parser

<img src="https://ps.w.org/plugin-readme-parser/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">WordPress README files are formatted using a version of the Markdown language. This plugin converts these files to XHTML and displays it on a post or page of your site.

It's ideal for plugin developers who wish to add instructions to their own site without duplication.

Features include:

* Convert your markdown README to XHTML and display in any post or page
* Use shortcodes or a direct PHP function call
* Responsive output of screenshots
* Output is cached for maximum performance
* Links automatically added to author and tag information
* Download links added
* Ability to specify which sections of the readme to exclude
* Can omit specific lines of text
* Extra shortcodes available to display plugin banners and to return specific plugin data (e.g. download link, version number)
* Google Translation suppressed on code output

Plugin README Parser uses [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/ "PHP Markdown Extra") by Michel Fortin.
